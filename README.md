## Installation

Embark on your Lingua Luxe Vision experience with these simple steps:

1. **Environment Preparation:**
    - Set up a Python 3.9 virtual environment, ensuring a smooth and isolated workspace.

2. **Dependency Installation:**
    - Install all required dependencies to empower your system:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Using Lingua Luxe Vision is straightforward. Follow these steps to generate images from Persian text:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where Lingua Luxe Vision is installed.

2. **Run the Script:** Use the following command format to start the image generation process. You can specify the type
   of model (`Detailed`, `Simple`, or `Both`), the input text in Persian, and the output directory where the generated
   image will be saved.

   ```bash
   python script_name.py --model [Model Type] --text "Your Persian Text" --output /path/to/output
   ```

    - `--model`: Choose the type of model for image generation. Options are `Detailed`, `Simple`, or `Both`. Default
      is `Simple` if not specified.
    - `--text`: Provide your input text in Persian. This is a required field.
    - `--output`: Specify the directory where you want the generated image to be saved. This is a required field.

   For example, to generate an image using the detailed model with specific text, your command might look like this:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py --model Detailed --text "ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å ÿ¥ŸÖÿß" --output /path/to/output
   ```

3. **View the Output:** After running the script, the generated image will be saved in the specified output directory.
   Navigate to this directory to view your image.
